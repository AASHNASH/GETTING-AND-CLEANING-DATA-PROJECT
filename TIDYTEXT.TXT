# Code Book: Tidy Dataset

This code book describes the variables in the tidy dataset `tidyData.txt` produced by `run_analysis.R`.

## Identifiers

- `SubjectNum`: The ID of the subject (1 to 30).
- `Activity`: The type of activity performed (e.g., WALKING, STANDING, LAYING).

## Measurement Variables

All other columns are the average of original measurements for each subject and activity. These variables were derived from:

- Accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals from the smartphone.
- Signals were separated into time and frequency domains.
- Only measurements with `mean()` and `std()` were selected.

Examples of variable names:

- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerSTDY`
- `FrequencyBodyGyroscopeSTDZ`

Variable names were cleaned:
- Parentheses `()` removed
- `-mean` â†’ `Mean`
- `-std` â†’ `STD`
- Hyphens `-` removed
